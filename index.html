		<p>Have already taken operating system course ?  </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may like to refresh concepts of a specific topic of operating system course:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to solve questions in Exercises of a specific lecture topic, if done easily, Good skip lecture topic.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise read lecture notes, or view lecture of the topic.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Acknowledgements</h2>
		
		<p>While teaching operating system course at Quaid-i-Azam University, I augmented my understating of operating systems from two main text books used for the course '<i>Operating System Concepts</i>' by A. Silberschatz et al' and  '<i>Operating Systems: Internal and Design Principles</i>' by W. Stallings. Lecture notes are also prepared from these books listed as recommended readings for this course.</p>

		<p>Exercises for lecture topics are mostly from course quizzes and exam papers at Quaid-i-Azam University, I am grateful to all students who solved those questions in exams and during lectures ask questions to clarify concepts of different topics.</p>

		<p>For lecture presentations some images and animation ideas are taken from OS lecture presentations available at web.</p>
